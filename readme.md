A collection of images and circuits captured mostly from , and IBM's Quantum Composer.

Exploring and discovering new Quantum circuit configurations, such as kunfermanpibase, a custom gate that is showing some very interesting results that may challenge much of what we know in the quantum world.

I'm looking for collaborators to help research and publish findings. Please let me know if you're interested. Thanks!
